# Bringing the results to (young) people in your city

## Peer-to-peer campaign

In a peer-to-peer campaign, participants address their networks directly. Your project involves participants from the groups that the project results are intended to reach, so the participants can pass on information effectively and in ways best suitable to their peers. Peer-to-peer campaigns offer the advantage of reaching many people in the desired target groups and in the most suitable ways. By interacting with their peers, participants also deepen their knowledge and gain self-confidence and self-efficacy.

To prepare participants, the workshops should include an introduction to the basics of how to communicate research findings in accessible ways and practical exercises on messaging and translating research language into everyday language. Depending on their interests, participants can produce their own texts, graphics, or even short videos for social media, or create a blog or podcast to accompany the research process. Helpful resources could include templates that can be easily edited, access to tools for video/audio production, and funding for paid social media campaigns.

## Public event

A concluding event at the end of the research process creates an opportunity to bring the co-researchers' findings to the wider city community, to discuss them with other young people and local stakeholders, and to begin to design solutions for next-level youth engagement in their city. This event could take place after the research phase concludes and when the co-researchers have identified initial findings.

The closing event is aimed at a wider group of people than those who have been involved as co-researchers: young people, city decision-makers, local experts, interested stakeholders, and members of the general public. A closing event is also a good opportunity to gather impressions from stakeholders and to invite the local press. It could take place in the city premises or a publicly accessible space (e.g., an event space or even a shopping mall).

Co-researchers should be involved in designing the program of the event. The program should offer co-researchers the opportunity to present their findings from the project, for example in a slideshow or a gallery walk, and opportunities to discuss findings with stakeholders and the general public, for example through feedback opportunities during the gallery walk or in a fishbowl discussion. In addition, participatory workshops that discuss aspects of the findings in more detail can strengthen the involvement of the attending stakeholders and general public.

The last few days of sitting in the group have been amazing to me. But more importantly, what ideas are going to emerge from this and then how do we help make those come to life?"

## Media (local and/or youth focused)

Local media or media outlets that target young people are excellent channels to bring 'Co-creating our city' insights to a wider group of young people in the city. Involving local media and youth-focused media outlets can help build or keep up pressure with city officials to achieve impact and close the feedback loop when changes are being made after the end of the project.

Local media or media outlets that target young people should be involved when communicating the project findings. Beyond that, opportunities for communication within the project may also arise from documenting the process and workshops, for example the kick-off, calls for participation in the project or in the research, the impact of the findings, or personal experiences of the participants.

The participants can provide valuable insights on suitable channels and media outlets based on their own media usage (e.g., youth media outlets, relevant discussion boards or social media sites, even local social media influencers). Perhaps the young co-researchers are themselves part of a youth editorial team or work on a school magazine where summaries of the findings could be placed.
