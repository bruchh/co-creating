# Get city leaders to take action based on research results

## A written report or slide deck

Decision-makers require a comprehensive overview of the research findings and methodology as a basis for developing and implementing solutions. This is best provided as a written briefing or report of findings because it provides city leaders with a clear and credible summary of the research that they can use to understand the evidence, to share with colleagues, funders, or partner organizations, and to justify decisions. Leaders often need documentation to support their decisions internally (to staff or departments) and externally (to the public, media, or other politicians). Written reports can distil complex data into actionable insights, helping decision-makers to quickly grasp key issues and implications and share them with others.

Reports could be delivered as a written report or an annotated slide deck. It is important to keep in mind that reports or slides may be used to brief city staff, funders, or partner organizations without any opportunity for the co-researchers to give further input. This means reports, slides, or data visualizations should be clear, professional, and largely self-explanatory. 

Reports can include findings, data insights, recommendations, and ideas that may be useful for turning findings into concrete policies or programs. Having a written record also creates transparency and makes it easier to track progress or revisit decisions on potential solutions later.

## Briefings

Briefings where the co-researchers explain their findings to decision-makers are essential for creating impact because they can make the findings more persuasive and memorable, and harder to ignore. 

First, when co-researchers present their findings directly to decision-makers, it highlights that the findings of 'Co-Creating Our City' projects are driven by young people and their communities, not imposed from outside. Direct engagement shows decision-makers that young people and the community are invested, which can create pressure to act.

Second, hearing directly from those who were involved in the project and affected by the issues brings recommendations to life and grounds them in real experiences. Co-researchers have deep insight into the context and needs behind the recommendations, helping leaders better understand the "why" behind the recommendations. Personal stories and firsthand perspectives can move decision-makers in ways that written reports alone often cannot.

Supporters of the project―your project champions from within the city administration or city council―are important door openers to get opportunities for in-person meetings or briefings. They may identify key contacts or arrange and schedule meetings. In Düsseldorf, for example, the co-researchers were given an official slot on the agenda of the youth welfare committee. In Charlotte, organizers briefed several city departments on relevant findings and brainstormed ideas for improving youth engagement with some of them.

::: info Case study: How the 'Co-Creating Our City' pilot project in Düsseldorf communicated findings to achieve impact

In Düsseldorf, the project team alongside selected co-researchers presented the project findings during a meeting of the Youth Welfare Council of the City of Düsseldorf, This council makes proposals for and decisions on matters of youth engagement in cit decision-making and convenes regularly to discuss issues concerning children and young people. The Council is composed of elected officials as well as representatives of various organizations involved in children and young people's welfare, engagement, and development.

Jointly with some of the co-researchers, the project team introduced the project and shared the main findings. It was important that some of the young co-researchers presented during the council meeting, contributing to the presentation as well as by bringing the findings to life based on their lived experience in the subsequent discussion.

This engagement with an official institution within the city council proved to be a valuable experience to achieve impact. The findings were communicated to the members of the city council who are best placed to make proposals and decisions based on the evidence presented and the engagement also demonstrated that the young participants cared deeply about the project and thoughtfully reflected on their own contributions. Their active presence ensured that they were taken seriously as part of the process, allowing for a shift in culture within the council as a decision-making institution.

In Charlotte, after the public event, project leads compiled a summary of the results for broader distribution. City participants are moving forward to implement some of the ideas and explore the feasibility of others in the coming months as part of the new Office of Youth Opportunity.
