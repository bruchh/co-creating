# Budgeting for your project

## Staff time

Depending on how you build your project team and staffing costs, the funding required for your own 'Co-Creating Our City' project might be relatively minimal. The main costs are incurred for staff time to plan and conduct the project, including recruitment of co-researchers, facilitating workshops, conducting and analyzing research, and disseminating the project findings. 

If you work alone or your team's time is (partially) paid for through existing roles in the city or a stakeholder organization, you may not have to consider this cost. If you plan on bringing on board team members whose time needs to be costed for this project, consider:

- The number of months or the number of individual events each team member is brought on for
- Their weekly working hours or hours worked to facilitate individual events
- The level of experience required for the role and what appropriate pay might be for that role
- The contract type used to bring on these members of staff and additional costs that may be incurred (e.g., social security or pension contributions, institutional overheads)

## Other costs

In addition to staff time, consider what you may need to budget for the following activities:

- Workshop facilitation, including room rent, catering for yourself and your co-researchers, and staff costs in case you use temporary facilitators
- Materials to use during workshops (e.g., flip chart paper, pens, subscriptions to digital tools)
- Incentives (gifts, vouchers, etc.) for your co-researchers should you decide to include these [read more about that here]
- Research costs (e.g., costs for hosting or distributing a survey, interview transcription, analysis software, catering or incentives for research participants, room rent for focus group discussions)
- Travel for your team and/or co-researchers to workshops and events
- Costs and fees for a closing event to share and discuss findings with the wider public
- Resources to support the dissemination of project findings (e.g., paying an editor/graphic designer to produce a final report, a video editor to produce videos of the project, costs to run a campaign on social media, paying a live illustrator to produce a visualization of discussions)
