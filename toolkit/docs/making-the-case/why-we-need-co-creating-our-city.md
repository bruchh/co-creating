# Why do we need projects like 'Co-creating our city'?

Many cities and municipalities recognize the importance of involving young people in community development and local governance. City leaders and local decision-makers benefit from insights gathered through structured dialogue with young people. Engaging young people's voices ensures that city governance is inclusive and sustainable, benefiting not just young people but the entire community.

However, despite these intentions, young people and city decision-makers can miss out on opportunities to meaningfully exchange ideas ―especially young people who are underrepresented, at risk, or may not yet have engaged with existing offerings. In many cities, there is a mismatch between the offered opportunities for exchange and what young people seek as engagement to enact their ideas about vibrant communities.

Young people want to contribute meaningfully to civic life if given the opportunity, but they can lack incentives and suitable pathways to do so. Cities, on the other hand, can lack efficient ways to engage in productive exchange with young residents. Traditional youth participation mechanisms (e.g., youth councils) can be experienced as tokenistic or disconnected from real decision-making.

  quote="We often compartmentalize our interactions with youth in government. People think of, like, youth protesting or they think of youth doing a program, or an internship. But we rarely really find ways to engage with what their thoughts are, and their opinions are, which is odd, because when we think about city plans, we usually plan out 15, 20 years. Somebody who is 16 now, that is who we are planning for in the future. So not having them involved in that process, I think we're really missing out on really good ideas."

## 'Co-creating our city' can address gaps in local youth engagement

'Co-creating our city' projects are collaborative projects that use a Citizen Science approach to do research steered and conducted jointly by local decision-makers and young people with lived experience of the issue being studied. Based on their research, young people and local decision-makers develop concrete proposals reflecting what young people want to see in their communities and what is feasible and achievable. The Citizen Science approach includes the perspectives, needs, and informal knowledge of those with exclusive access to their communities.

'Co-creating our city' projects offer a way to meaningfully involve young people in decision-making, research design and delivery, and policymaking. The approach empowers the co-researchers, young people and decision-makers alike, to work together, to articulate their ideas of youth engagement and vibrant communities, and to use scientific research methods and engage in impactful discussions about these ideas (thereby addressing important objectives of scientific and democratic literacy), as well as to experience real-life political efficacy by promoting change in their cities.

At its core, co-creation and Citizen Science methods represent a paradigm shift: They challenge entrenched ideas about who holds legitimate knowledge and decision-making power, disrupting power imbalances that can exclude young people's voices. This brings young people's experiences and ideas to the forefront of local initiatives and ensures that young people are not just consulted but positioned as essential partners in the creation of more inclusive, responsive, and democratic cities.

::: info Principles of 'Co-creating our city' projects

- 'Co-creating our city' projects actively involve members of the studied community and local decision-makers in the process of generating new knowledge about, or understanding of, the needs of their communities.

- 'Co-creating our city' projects answer a genuine question about how to improve engagement in local communities and seek to conduct high quality research to produce actionable and impactful findings.

- 'Co-creating our city' projects strive to involve young people and local decision-makers as co-researchers in as many aspects of the research process as possible.

- Participants in 'Co-creating our city' projects, whether project leaders, young people, or adults, benefit from taking part and gaining new perspectives to help strengthen their understanding.

- 'Co-creating our city' projects take into consideration legal and ethical issues surrounding data protection, copyright, intellectual property, confidentiality, attribution, and the impact of any activities on communities.

Co-creation in local governance was first described in 1978 by economist Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University, who emphasized the importance of citizen involvement in the creation of knowledge and decision-making. Ostrom argued that when communities are actively involved in shaping the policies and services that affect them, outcomes are more responsive, equitable, and sustainable.

Co-creation projects can be intentionally designed to reflect what people truly want and need, leading to greater public engagement, more efficient use of resources, and improved public service delivery.

In a community project setting, the mutual sharing of power, experience, and expertise fosters stronger communication, trust, and unity among residents, ultimately strengthening democratic governance and collective ownership of local outcomes.
