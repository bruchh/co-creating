# Legal and ethical considerations

When working with young people and adult decision-makers in a 'Co-Creating Our City' project, it is crucial to consider legal and ethical aspects to ensure safety, respect, and compliance with relevant laws. 

## Consent to participate

Co-researchers and research participants need to provide voluntary and informed consent to participating in the project and the research it involves. Consent forms for both co-researchers and research participants should be age appropriate and clearly explain the purpose of the project, what participation involves, risks/benefits, and participants' right to withdraw their consent and how and when they can do so. 

For co-researchers and research participants who are minors (under 16 or under 18 depending on the laws in your country or local area), informed consent must be obtained from a parent or legal guardian, and from the young person themself. Co-researchers and participants who are legally considered adults can provide informed consent directly. 

Check your country and locality's guidance (for example, in the US, your state) on research integrity and informed consent:

- [European Network for Research Integrity and Ethics (ENERI)](https://eneri.eu/)
- [United States Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html)

You can use the example consent form to adapt to your country's requirements.

## Permission to use photos, video, or audio

You may want to take pictures or make audio or video recordings of workshops and events to help with the dissemination of your project findings and as a reminder of what was discussed. Written permission must be obtained before capturing or sharing identifiable images, video, or audio of co-researchers and participants. For minors, this includes permission from both the young person and their parent/guardian.

Consent forms should specify:

- That the participant (and their parent/guardian) explicitly agree to have their image and/or voice captured.
- Where and how the material will be used (e.g., social media, reports, public events),
- The right to withdraw permission later, and how and when this can be done,
- Whether a young person's full name will be used on marketing materials.

## Data protection

Participating in the project as co-researchers likely involves the sharing of personal data, including names, contact details, dietary or other sensitive information. This data must be securely stored and processed in line with your country's data protection laws (e.g., GDPR in the EU). Participants must be informed about:

- What data is collected
- How it will be used
- Who will have access
- How long it will be stored and when it will be deleted

Research participants (e.g., interviewees, survey participants) also provide personal data, for example through their responses. This data must also be handled securely and in line with local data protection laws. In addition, anonymization or pseudonymization should be used where possible to protect people's identities.

## Child and youth protection

Depending on the laws in your country and who you recruit as co-researchers and research participants, you may be required to comply with child safeguarding policies and youth protection laws. In many countries participants who are under 16 or under 18 are legal minors and this requirement would apply to you and your project team.

Safeguarding policies often require:

- Staff, researchers, and facilitators working with youth undergo background checks prior to any interaction with underage participants
- Staff be hired who have appropriate professional qualifications or experience and are trained in safeguarding and ethical youth engagement
- Ensuring safe environments (physical and online)
- Avoiding situations where adults are alone with young participants
- Having clear reporting procedures for suspected abuse
- Having a clear code of conduct and supervision structure for staff
- Preparing and reviewing a risk assessment before the project starts
