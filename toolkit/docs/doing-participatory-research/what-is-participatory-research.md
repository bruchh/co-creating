# What is participatory research?

Participatory research is a collaborative approach to knowledge creation that engages those affected by an issue as equal partners in all research stages. Unlike traditional research, where experts shape and conduct research, participatory research shares power and decision-making with community members who act as co-researchers. These co-researchers help define research questions, collect and analyze data, and apply findings to create real-world impact. 

Participatory research is an umbrella term for research methods involving the active participation of community members. Among these, co-creation and Citizen Science represent distinct but overlapping models, each varying in how power, knowledge, and roles are shared within the research process. 

Rooted in inclusion and social justice, participatory research values lived experience alongside expert knowledge. It fosters mutual learning and social action in communities, builds trust, improves data quality, and empowers participants to contribute their lived experience. In this way, participatory research yields relevant and directly actionable insights aligned with local priorities. 

## What are co-creation and Citizen Science?

Within participatory research methods, co-creation involves participants and researchers jointly creating research agendas, deciding on methodologies, and defining outcomes. The focus of Citizen Science, in contrast, is on members of the general public conducting research, for example data collection or analysis.

There are various typologies to capture the many forms of participatory research, co-creation, and Citizen Science (see, for example, Shirk et al., 2012, and Bonney et al., 2009). They differentiate contribution, collaboration, and co-creation based on the level of engagement of co-researchers and the amount of control research teams are willing to hand over. With increasing levels of engagement of community members, project teams can achieve more inclusive and impactful research outcomes.

**Contribution** refers to projects where participants primarily collect or submit data according to protocols designed by researchers, typically without input into other parts of the research.

**Collaboration** involves participants more actively, not only in data collection but also in refining research questions, analyzing data, or helping with the dissemination of research findings.

**Co-creation** represents the highest level of engagement, where community members and researchers join forces to design, conduct, and disseminate research, sharing control and responsibilities throughout the process.

**Key aspects of co-creation and Citizen Science:**

- Active citizen engagement in several research stages: in decisions on the research question, the choice of methods, data collection, analysis, and the interpretation and dissemination of findings.
- Collaboration and equal partnerships between institutional researchers and unaffiliated volunteers who act as co-researchers, for example young people.
- A commitment to rigor, transparency, and sharing of knowledge.
- Empowerment, capacity building, trust and enhanced relationships between researchers and the communities they research.

## What are the benefits of co-creation and Citizen Science? 

Co-creation and Citizen Science methods represent a shift towards democratizing research and the knowledge it creates, making research findings more inclusive, transparent, and aligned with the needs of the communities it affects. These methods emphasize equity, knowledge sharing, and actionable outcomes, transforming those traditionally "researched on" into empowered collaborators and strengthening the bonds among experts, practitioners, and the community for shared benefit. 

Co-creation and Citizen Science offer a range of benefits for different stakeholders: researchers, communities, participants, and policymakers.

### Benefits for researchers

Co-creation inspires new research agendas by raising new questions and including ideas based on community knowledge. This is particularly true when co-researchers include young people who would not typically be involved in research teams. The involvement of co-researchers also ensures that results are relevant and directly actionable. This increases the acceptance of recommended solutions within the community.

### Benefits for communities

For communities, co-creation and Citizen Science foster community learning. The approach empowers community members, in particular young people, to take part in research and exposes them to new and diverse points of view that exist within the community. By involving community members from the beginning, co-creation encourages research that is relevant and transparent and promotes the effective transfer of research findings into practice. It democratizes the meaning and practice of research, strengthening both communities and the outcomes they can expect from institutions.

  quote="This has been an amazing project so far. It taught me so much about Charlotte I have not known before. Things like how it runs, like certain departments. I got to meet so many new people that are passionate about the same things as me. I never had the heart to learn anything about politics and my city itself. So this is all very new to me, and I found it very interesting."

  quote="It's been a lot of fun working with people. There are a lot of different people with different experiences and different ways of life. And then just seeing how other people see things that you might see very differently and to experience how young people who come up in interviews or fill in questionnaires, how they see politics and how they find contact with politics. I found all of that very interesting."

### Benefits for participants

Participants in co-creation and Citizen Science projects can directly contribute to research discoveries. Their involvement offers young people and city leaders opportunities to build research skills and can deepen their understanding and appreciation of evidence in policymaking, promoting the idea that rigorous research can improve policy and communities for the better. Through their participation, co-researchers gain a better grasp of the complexity of issues the community faces, they contribute to the development of solutions and can experience efficacy in political decision-making. Lastly, the experience is also enjoyable and fosters a sense of trust and belonging.

  quote="My opinion of the city was better because I was like 'Look at These kinds of people that are working for my city'. I got to learn like a ton of stuff that I didn't know before that was being done and kind of the importance of some of the stuff that was being done. And I was like 'Oh, OK, well, you know, this is more interesting than I thought. I can see what work goes into running a city.'"

### Benefits for policymakers

Policymakers benefit from improved communication with citizens, which leads to better public engagement in decision-making. The inclusion of citizen perspectives ensures that decisions and regulations are more effectively implemented and grounded in current issues. By involving the public, Citizen Science builds broader support for policy measures and provides a wealth of up-to-date, real-world information. This also helps authorities monitor the effects of regulations more accurately and adapt policies as necessary.

  quote="I found it quite impressive that the young people very quickly got the point that there are some youth who have opportunities to participate politically and others who either do not have them or do not make use of them. This imbalance of opportunities became a topic right away in the workshop and was clearly worked out up to the research question of why certain young people do not take advantage of these political participation opportunities."
