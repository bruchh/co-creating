# From steps to action: Working with co-researchers

To set up and conduct the five steps of participatory research, researchers and co-researchers need to establish effective ways of working and a strong basis for collaboration. They need to collaborate:

- at certain points in time, e.g., when you are establishing your research question and research objectives, and
- over extended periods of time, e.g., when you are collecting and analyzing data.

## Workshops as space for collaboration with co-researchers

To make space for collaboration at specific points in time, consider organizing a series of workshops where both young people and city decision-makers come together to exchange ideas, build trust, and actively co-design and implement the research project.

Workshops provide a structured yet flexible environment, in which researchers and co-researchers can work and learn together, share knowledge, align expectations, and jointly address challenges. Ideally onsite and with face-to-face interaction, workshops foster mutual understanding and empower co-researchers to take on meaningful roles in the research process and become involved Citizen Scientists, while researchers gain valuable insights from participants' lived experiences and contextual knowledge.

Workshops can be used to work through the five steps of the Citizen Science model one-by-one or they can combine two or more steps into longer sessions, for example a full day or a weekend. This should be decided based on the needs and availability of your co-researchers.

One possible option is to conduct five half-day, in-person workshops over the course of the project duration, with online collaboration to prepare for workshops, add ideas, and accompany data collection tasks in between:

- **Workshop 1 – Setting the foundation:** Introduce the project goals, co-define the research questions, and discuss the roles of the co-researchers. Build rapport among participants and clarify the expectations and ways of working.

- **Workshop 2 – Planning the research methods:** Decide collectively on data collection methods, tools, and responsibilities. Provide initial training for co-researchers to build research skills and become Citizen Scientists.

- **Workshop 3 – Preparing data collection:** Fine-tune materials and protocols for data collection based on pilots and participant feedback. Address any logistical or technical issues.

- **Workshop 4 – Data analysis and interpretation:** Facilitate collaborative data analysis where Citizen Scientists and researchers jointly review and interpret the data, share perspectives, and triangulate and validate findings.

- **Workshop 5 – Dissemination and achieving impact:** Co-create dissemination strategies tailored to target audiences and discuss how to maintain the collaboration and achieve impact beyond the project, including potential further research or community action.

## Online collaboration with co-researchers between workshops

To maintain momentum and continuity between workshops and over extended periods of time, you can consider complementing these onsite workshops with forms of online collaboration, either synchronously, for example through online sessions, or asynchronously, through digital collaboration tools. Digital platforms such as project management tools or messaging boards allow the group to stay connected, share updates, discuss ongoing tasks, and prepare for the next in-person meetings, thus blending the benefits of in-person interaction with the convenience of remote collaboration.

The combination of workshops with ongoing digital collaboration allows the group to progress through each step with shared responsibility, ensuring transparency, inclusion, and a drive to achieve change. It also fosters a vibrant community of practice that strengthens partnerships between researchers and communities, maximizing both the quality of the research findings and their impact.

**Materials and resources collection**

You can access the slides from the pilot project, which can give you ideas and serve as a foundation for your workshops. Note that you will have to make adjustments to suit your own project. The slides only give you some orientation, and ideas for what to consider for the workshops.

A model plan for a workshop to develop the research question will help you design your own workshops.

::: info Recommendations on online tools

For ongoing interaction, here are some recommendations on online tools, clearly explaining which tools fit various tasks (such as communication, data management, and collaboration):

**Slack** - Slack is a team communication platform that supports real-time messaging, file sharing, and audio/video calls organized into channels. Its intuitive interface and integrations with tools like Google Drive and Trello make team coordination easy and enhance productivity.

**Discord** - Originally designed for gamers, Discord has become popular among youth for its voice, video, and text chat capabilities. It allows users to create servers with multiple channels, making it ideal for both casual and project collaboration in a secure, community-focused environment.

**Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides)** - Google Workspace offers free, cloud-based apps that enable real-time document editing, spreadsheet collaboration, and presentation building. Its ease of access and automatic saving promote seamless teamwork and efficient sharing without version conflicts.

**Trello** - Trello uses a visual Kanban board system to help individuals and teams organize tasks through cards and lists. It's great for managing projects with deadlines and priorities, providing a simple way to track progress and assign responsibilities.

**Miro** - Miro is an online whiteboard platform that supports collaborative brainstorming, planning, and visualization. Its interactive features such as sticky notes, drawing tools, and templates facilitate dynamic group sessions and creative workflow management.

These tools are popular because they combine user-friendly interfaces with powerful features that foster communication, organization, and collaboration, often with generous free-tier options suitable for young users and small teams.
