## 2. Challenge and Vision

### Inhalt

**Challenge:**

Many cities and municipalities recognize the value of involving young people in community development and local governance. Yet, despite good intentions, meaningful engagement often remains out of reach. Traditional approaches to youth participation — such as youth councils or consultations — can feel tokenistic, disconnected from real power and decision-making, or inaccessible, especially to underrepresented youth. Young people want to contribute ideas to their communities, but they often lack clear pathways, incentives, or opportunities to do so. At the same time, city leaders can struggle to efficiently gather the insights and perspectives of young residents, leading to missed opportunities for dialogue, collaboration, and more inclusive policymaking.

**Approach:**

Co-Creating Our City addresses this challenge using a Citizen Science approach — a collaborative research method where young people and local decision-makers jointly explore local challenges, gather data, and develop actionable solutions. By centering lived experience and combining it with policy expertise, Co-Creating Our City projects create structured dialogue, build mutual trust, and ensure that youth perspectives are integrated into decision-making. Young people and local decision-makers work together to identify what young people want to see and what is feasible to implement in their communities, turning research into concrete solutions for more vibrant and inclusive communities. This approach not only strengthens youth participation locally; it also builds trust between young people and local institutions, develops skills, confidence, and understanding of civic processes, and establishes a culture of open dialogue and mutual respect, empowering both young residents and city leaders to enact meaningful change in their cities.

**Theory of Change:**

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| • Young people are given structured, supported opportunities to collaboratively research and reflect on their voice in local democracy<br>• Young people are meaningfully engaged in co-designing solutions with local officials, not just consulted after the fact<br>• City officials are willing to engage in open dialogue and see youth as partners in governance | • Young people will develop a stronger sense of civic agency, understanding their ability to shape public life and policy<br>• City officials will gain deeper insight into youth needs and experiences, increasing their capacity to design inclusive policies<br>• Trust and communication between young residents and city institutions will improve, deepening participatory democracy and making it more sustainable<br>• The city will be better equipped to institutionalize youth participation beyond one-off projects, creating a change in the culture of how youth engagement is viewed and practiced |

### Quotes to highlight

> **Kayleigh Mayhew, Citizen Scientist from Charlotte:** Ultimately, we are the future. And I feel like making sure that our voices are heard and that we feel well educated and have the opportunity to bring change and bring an impact to our own communities, and forming communities that want to stay connected, is important. It's just better for our future and it's better for forming strong communities.

> **LaKeeshia Fox, City of Charlotte:** Youth are so insightful and so wise. It really benefits us to incorporate youth in our planning and design of programming that we're thinking about as a city.

> **Alexis Gordon, City of Charlotte:** We often compartmentalize our interactions with youth in government. People think of like youth protesting or they think of youth doing a program, or an internship. But we rarely really find ways to engage with what their thoughts are and their opinions are, which is odd, because when we think about city plans, we usually plan out 15, 20 years. So somebody who is 16 now, that is who we are planning for in the future. So, not having them involved in that process, I think we're really missing out on really good ideas.

## 3. How it works

### Content

**Brief explanation of the citizen science approach:**

- **V1:** Co-Creating Our City uses a Citizen Science approach — a form of collaborative research where those directly affected by an issue take part in studying and solving it. In these projects, young people and local decision-makers jointly explore challenges in their communities, gather and analyze data, and co-develop actionable proposals. By combining youth perspectives and institutional knowledge, the approach strengthens trust, enhances youth participation, and helps cities design more inclusive, responsive, and democratic policies.

- **V2:** Co-Creating Our City brings together young people and local leaders through Citizen Science — research done with the community, not on it. Together, they study issues that matter to young residents, share knowledge and experiences, and develop realistic proposals for change. This collaborative approach empowers youth to take part in decision-making, builds trust between generations, and supports cities in becoming more inclusive and youth-friendly.

**Comparison:**

| Traditional solutions | Co-created solutions |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| • Created for young people<br>• Hierarchical way of working<br>• Adult expertise privileged<br>• Knowledge produced for decision-makers and expert audiences | • Created with young people and local decision-makers<br>• Collaborative way of working<br>• Multiple forms of expertise valued<br>• Knowledge produced for practical application and shared with stakeholders |

**Process:**

1. **Define a common research goal:** Include different perspectives and rely on co-researchers to consider the relevance for the community.

2. **Determine methodological approach:** Consider what suits the research question and take into account the co-researchers' ideas, access, and lived experience.

3. **Collect data:** Train and involve co-researchers in data collection.

4. **Analyze data:** Train and involve co-researchers in the analysis of data.

5. **Disseminate and use findings:** Distill key recommendations and choose accessible forms of presentation and communication that suit your target audiences.

**Optional: Principles of 'Co-creating our city' projects**

- Co-creating Our City projects actively involve members of the studied community and local decision-makers in the process of generating new knowledge about, or understanding of, the needs of their communities.

- Co-creating Our City projects answer a genuine question about how to improve engagement in local communities and seek to conduct high quality research to produce actionable and impactful findings.

- Co-creating Our City projects strive to involve young people and local decision-makers as co-researchers in as many aspects of the research process as possible.

- Participants in Co-creating Our City projects, whether project leaders, young people, or adults, benefit from taking part and gaining new perspectives to help strengthen their understanding.

- Co-creating Our City projects take into consideration legal and ethical issues surrounding data protection, copyright, intellectual property, confidentiality, attribution, and the impact of any activities on communities.

- Co-creating Our City participants are adequately compensated and acknowledged in project results and publications. They are informed about the impact of their work and actively involved in sharing findings with stakeholders in their communities.

- Co-creating Our City projects are evaluated for their research, participant experience, and wider societal or policy impact.

**Meaningful Quotes:**

*LG: Ich würde mindestens 1 junge Person und eine*n Stadtvertreter*in zitieren, um beide Perspektiven zu zeigen*

> **Dr. Raquishela Stewart, City of Charlotte:** I'm learning things that I did not know as far as how the young people want to be communicated with, some of the things that they're interested in. So it's going to allow us to take that information back and to reframe our programming, so that it is more suitable to what the youth want and we can combine that with what they need.

> **Megha Mittal, Citizen scientist from Charlotte:** We don't really typically get to connect with city officials as much. I think having initiatives like 'Co-creating our city' will bridge that gap and allow us to better understand the government and also for them to understand like what we might like.

> **Mauricio Martinez Aguirre, Citizen Scientist from Charlotte:** I always thought I have to do this or I'll create change when I grow up. And then coming here and doing this, I realized, oh, I can do change. Like right now, I don't have to wait.
